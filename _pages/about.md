Hello! Welcome to my page!

I am Kumar Siddhant, originally from a small town called Talcher, popular for coal mines, from India. I am now pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick with specialization in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Right now I am learning more about Big Data applications, distributed computing and schedulling algorithms and looking out for full-time opportunities in the field of Data Science.

Before joining Rutgers, I worked in Verizon India as a software developer and spent a great deal of time in understanding the software industry and honing the programming skills. 

Apart from involving myself in computer and programming, I like to spend some time in music, reading fictions and watching soccer.

Hoping for a great time in Rutgers and looking forward for meeting you soon!
