This is Kumar Siddhant. Welcome to my page!

I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick with an expected graduation in Spring 2019.

I have worked on research projects based on Robotics, AI and animation and want to broaden my knowledge in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Presently enrolled in courses like Deep Learning and Computer Intervention in Medicine. Actively
looking for Research Assistant opportunities in the summer in the field of Computer Vision.

Before joining Rutgers, I worked in Verizon India as a software developer and spent a great deal of time in understanding the software industry and honing the programming skills. 

Apart from involving myself in computer and programming, I like to spend some time in music, reading fictions and watching soccer.

Hoping for a great time in Rutgers and looking forward for meeting you soon!
