In this project, I am researching and analyzing the efficiency of various scheduling algorithms for the Radical proprietary software namely Radical-Pilot. RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is a Pilot Job system written in Python. It allows a user to run large numbers of computational tasks (called ComputeUnits) concurrently on one or more remote ComputePilots that RADICAL-Pilot can start transparently on a multitude of different distributed resources, like HPC clusters and Clouds. Ater the analysis, I will be implementating the scheduling algorithms on Radical-Pilot.
