In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed and trained to classify the thoracic diseases from the chest X-ray images that are available from the NIH database. The images available in the NIH database are labelled by Wang et al and are updated in a csv file. The objective of this project is to use the data and train a CNN from scratch or use a pre-trained CNN like AlexNet or VGG and classify the thoracic diseases from the chest radiographs.
