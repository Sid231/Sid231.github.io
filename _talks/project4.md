The Project is based on multi-robot based coordination and a study on their behavior as they come across an obstacle or any object in their path while moving towards a particular goal. The robots are programmed and are controlled by the intelligence programmed to them i.e. called the Swarm Intelligence.
The simulations are first carried out in MATLAB considering a robot as a point. The points (the robots) are positioned at their respective positions and they have to reach the goal by bypassing an obstacle (a large sphere in this case). The trajectory obtained from the particles is saved for animation using Python-Ogre. The animation of the problem statement is done in Python-Ogre for proper visualization of the robots, their behavior and coordination. The robotic entities have to follow the trajectory obtained from the MATLAB simulation. The particles were intelligently controlled using Swarm Intelligence algorithms and were successfully simulated in MATLAB and animated in Python-Ogre.
