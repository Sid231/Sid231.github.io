The algorithm that can perform prediction is based on a stochastic model on the HMM theory. This model is based on the concept of collaborative filtering where the algorithm predicts the context of the user based on the context observation of the users related to the primary user. This model can also use homomorphic encryption to preserve privacy of the users involved. In order to evaluate this model, we developed and used a context feature collection application to obtain data. Due to issues with one of the devices, only one device's features were successfully collected. In order to evaluate the collaborative aspect of HCFContext, we synthetically create collaborators from this real dataset. Using this, we then evaluate the algorithm's predictions against the sample data.
